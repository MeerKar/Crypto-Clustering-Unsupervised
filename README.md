# Crypto-Clustering-Unsupervised

In this project we are using Python and unsupervised learning to predict if cryptocurrencies are affected by 24-hour or 7-day price changes.

### Prepare the Data

To normalize the data from the CSV file  the StandardScaler() module from scikit-learn is used.

Then created a DataFrame with the scaled data and set the "coin_id" index from the original DataFrame as the index for the new DataFrame.

The first five rows of the scaled DataFrame appear as follows:

### Find the Best Value for k Using the Original Scaled DataFrame


To find the best value for k using  the elbow method  with the following steps:

Created a list with the number of k values from 1 to 11.

Created an empty list to store the inertia values.

Created a for loop to compute the inertia with each possible value of k.

Created a dictionary with the data to plot the elbow curve.

Plotted a line chart with all the inertia values computed with the different values of k to visually identify the optimal value for k.

### Cluster Cryptocurrencies with K-means Using the Original Scaled Data

Using the following steps to cluster the cryptocurrencies for the best value for k on the original scaled data:

Initialized the K-means model with the best value for k.

Fit the K-means model using the original scaled DataFrame.

Predict the clusters to group the cryptocurrencies using the original scaled DataFrame.
Then,
Created a copy of the original data and added a new column with the predicted clusters.

Created a scatter plot using hvPlot as follows:

Setting the x-axis as "price_change_percentage_24h" and the y-axis as "price_change_percentage_7d".
Colored the graph points with the labels found using K-means.
Added the "coin_id" column in the hover_cols parameter to identify the cryptocurrency represented by each data point.

### Optimize Clusters with Principal Component Analysis

 Performed a PCA and reduce the features to three principal components using the original scaled DataFrame.

Retrieved the explained variance to determine how much information can be attributed to each principal component .

What is the total explained variance of the three principal components?

Created a new DataFrame with the PCA data and set the "coin_id" index from the original DataFrame as the index for the new DataFrame.

The first five rows of the PCA DataFrame appeared as follows:

### Find the Best Value for k Using the PCA Data

Using the elbow method on the PCA data to find the best value for k using the following steps:

Created a list with the number of k-values from 1 to 11.

Created an empty list to store the inertia values.

Created a for loop to compute the inertia with each possible value of k.

Created a dictionary with the data to plot the Elbow curve.

Setting the x-axis as "PCA1" and the y-axis as "PCA2".

Color the graph points with the labels found using K-means.

Add the "coin_id" column in the hover_cols parameter to identify the cryptocurrency represented by each data point.

Along with this , i have created a 3D plot to show the prediction which felt appropriate.

# Conclusion:

What is the impact of using fewer features to cluster the data using K-Means?

The conclusion is, generally using less features results in similar outcomes to the base model as the fitting shows 4 clusters 
Reducing the number of features (columns) helps make the clusters more apparent.
